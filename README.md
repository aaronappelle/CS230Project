 Winter 2021 Project CS230

ABSTRACT

Post-earthquake damage surveys currently require teams of domain experts to
visually inspect buildings to determine their safety, which is slow and subjective.
Efforts to automate the process using computer vision have been limited due to the
time and resource cost of labeling earthquake survey images. In this project I use
pseudo-labeling to take advantage of large numbers of unlabeled reconnaissance
images available on the web in a semi-supervised learning approach. I investigate
the effects of changing the start-epoch of pseudo-labeling during training. Results
show that prediction accuracy improved by up to 5% on a test set from the unlabeled
data, although improvement is sensitive to the accuracy of the base model.
